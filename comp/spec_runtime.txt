Parts of the runtime system:

* creating a new instance
** [if using versioned classes: get latest version of this class]
** count the number of ivars of this class, it's superclasses and all mixins
** cache it in Class
** allocate memory
** put reference to class in there
** [if using a list of instances for each class: insert it there]
** return reference to memory
