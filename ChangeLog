	* fond/callable.c: added `heap_frame' as a attribut for methods
	and blocks, so that the VM doesn't have to walk the code at
	runtime to see whether the frame should be in heap or on stack;
	anonymous class methods (those for defining classes) always use
	heap;
	killed syntax check;
	deprecated ilang_walker;

	* comp/generator.c: ivars working; didn't generate code that makes
	the step from Method to Callable for `invoke' which Class#new is
	using

	* comp/generator.c: integration of Blocks; all tests except those
	for ivars are running.

	* comp/generator.c: starting refactoring work for generating
	variables 

2002-02-24  Markus Liedl  <markus.lado@gmx.de>

	* configuration.rb: reworked configuration.rb: files are now
	generated from configure.rb

	* comp/generator.c: started working on proc creation; not sure
	whether the contents of the closure should be specified explicitly
	(that means, the generator wouldn't have to walk through the
	proc's code to search for what context variables are used (and
	therefore have to be in the closure)
