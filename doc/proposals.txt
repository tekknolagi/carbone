vmgen4rb
--------
Ruby parser for vmgen .vmg files
Ruby writer for those files
(in between some Ruby datastructure)

carbone based rb2c translator (needs .vmg parser, when done with Ruby)


garbage collection:
-------------------
young generation frontend to Boehm collector. It could be much more
general than targetting only the Carbone VM; measure performance of a
copying collector; write barrier;



Framework for builtins that are written in C
--------------------------------------------
Should support inlining into the VM, but also as a dynamically loaded
library. Could be used by all C builtins, so everything can be left
out when compiling Carbone.
see  carbone/tests/basics/gc; boehm-tree.c tries to measures Boehm GC
