Garbage Collection
------------------

Till now I haven't made  great efforts for the garbage collector (just
linked in  Boehm's collector.  Maybe I won't  do since it  seems quite
efficient  (but  then,  I  haven't  yet  done  realistic  tests;  only
tests/ivars.lg and tests/lvars.lg, where all objects die very soon).

The following environment variables may be interesting

  export GC_PRINT_STATS=1          reports GC activity

  export GC_DONT_GC=1              Together with the first option:
                                   shows complete memory need.


Note:  A  faster  solution  would  probably be  to  use  a  compacting
collector for  the youngest generation,  and something else  for older
inhabitants (e.g. Boehm collector; train-collector, ..).
